<h1 align="center"> Install 💎</h1>

Use it in the directory where you want to create the `LICENSE` file. The first two arguments to the command are the full name that you want to be attached to the License file and third is the website or email that you wish was attached.


Running this :

If you wish, you can create an [alias](http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/aliases.html) to simplify this. For example I have this alias that I use :

```Bash
alias mit='license-up Nikita Voloboev nikitavoloboev.xyz'
```
