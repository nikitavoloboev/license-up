		"  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n" +

		"if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\n" +
		"in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n" +
		"  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n" +
		"anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\n" +
		"These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\n" +
		"distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n" +
		"  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n" +
		"gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\n" +

		"  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\n" +
		"that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n" +

		"want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\n" +
		"that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\n" +
		"authors' reputations.\n\n" +
		"  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\n" +

		"  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n" +

		"                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n" +
		"   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n" +
		"  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\n" +
		"a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\n" +
		"under the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\n" +
		"refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\n" +
		"means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\n" +
		"that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\n" +
		"either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\n" +
		"language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\n" +
		"the term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n" +
		"Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n" +
		"covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\n" +
		"running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\n" +
		"is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\n" +
		"Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\n" +
		"Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n" +
		"  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\n" +
		"source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\n" +
		"conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\n" +
		"copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\n" +
		"notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\n" +
		"and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\n" +
		"along with the Program.\n\n" +
		"You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\n" +
		"you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n" +
		"  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\n" +
		"of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\n" +
		"distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n" +
		"above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n" +
		"    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n" +
		"    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n" +
		"    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n" +
		"    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n" +
		"    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n" +
		"    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n" +
		"    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n" +
		"    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n" +
		"    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n" +
		"    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n" +
		"    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n" +
		"    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n" +
		"    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n" +
		"    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n" +
		"    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n" +
		"    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\n" +
		"These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\n" +
		"identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\n" +
		"and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n" +
		"themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n" +
		"sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\n" +
		"distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\n" +
		"on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n" +
		"this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n" +
		"entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\n" +
		"Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n" +
		"your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n" +
		"exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n" +
		"collective works based on the Program.\n\n" +
		"In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\n" +
		"with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\n" +
		"a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\n" +
		"the scope of this License.\n\n" +
		"  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\n" +
		"under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\n" +
		"Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n" +
		"    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n" +
		"    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n" +
		"    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n" +
		"    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n" +
		"    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n" +
		"    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n" +
		"    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n" +
		"    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n" +
		"    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n" +
		"    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n" +
		"    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n" +
		"    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n" +
		"    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n" +
		"    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\n" +
		"The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n" +
		"making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\n" +
		"code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\n" +
		"associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\n" +
		"control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\n" +
		"special exception, the source code distributed need not include\n" +
		"anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\n" +
		"form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\n" +
		"operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\n" +
		"itself accompanies the executable.\n\n" +
		"If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\n" +
		"access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\n" +
		"access to copy the source code from the same place counts as\n" +
		"distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\n" +
		"compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n" +
		"  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\n" +
		"except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\n" +
		"otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\n" +
		"void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\n" +
		"However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\n" +
		"this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\n" +
		"parties remain in full compliance.\n\n" +
		"  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n" +
		"signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n" +
		"distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\n" +
		"prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\n" +
		"modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\n" +
		"Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\n" +
		"all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n" +
		"the Program or works based on it.\n\n" +
		"  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\n" +
		"Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n" +
		"original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\n" +
		"these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\n" +
		"restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n" +
		"You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\n" +
		"this License.\n\n" +
		"  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n" +
		"infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n" +
		"conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n" +
		"otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n" +
		"excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\n" +
		"distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n" +
		"License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\n" +
		"may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\n" +
		"license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\n" +
		"all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\n" +
		"the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n" +
		"refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\n" +
		"If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\n" +
		"any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\n" +
		"apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\n" +
		"circumstances.\n\n" +
		"It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n" +
		"patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n" +
		"such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n" +
		"integrity of the free software distribution system, which is\n" +
		"implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\n" +
		"generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n" +
		"through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n" +
		"system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\n" +
		"to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\n" +
		"impose that choice.\n\n" +
		"This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\n" +
		"be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n" +
		"  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\n" +
		"certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n" +
		"original copyright holder who places the Program under this License\n" +
		"may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\n" +
		"those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\n" +
		"countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\n" +
		"the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n" +
		"  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\n" +
		"of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\n" +
		"be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\n" +
		"address new problems or concerns.\n\n" +
		"Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\n" +
		"specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\n" +
		"later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\n" +
		"either of that version or of any later version published by the Free\n" +
		"Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\n" +
		"this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\n" +
		"Foundation.\n\n" +
		"  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\n" +
		"programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\n" +
		"to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\n" +
		"Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\n" +
		"make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\n" +
		"of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\n" +
		"of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n" +
		"                            NO WARRANTY\n\n" +
		"  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\n" +
		"FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\n" +
		"OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\n" +
		"PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\n" +
		"OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n" +
		"MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\n" +
		"TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\n" +
		"PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\n" +
		"REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n" +
		"  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\n" +
		"WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\n" +
		"REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\n" +
		"INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\n" +
		"OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\n" +
		"TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\n" +
		"YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\n" +
		"PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\n" +
		"POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n" +
		"                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n" +
		"            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n" +
		"  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\n" +
		"possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\n" +
		"free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n" +
		"  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\n" +
		"to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\n" +
		"convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\n" +
		"the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n" +

		"  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\n" +
		"these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\n" +
		"certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\n" +
		"you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n" +
		"  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n" +
		"gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\n" +
		"freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\n" +

		"  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n" +
		"(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\n" +
		"giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n" +
		"  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\n" +
		"that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\n" +
		"authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\n" +
		"changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\n" +
		"authors of previous versions.\n\n" +
		"  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\n" +
		"modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\n" +
		"can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\n" +
		"protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\n" +
		"pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\n" +
		"use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\n" +
		"have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\n" +
		"products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\n" +
		"stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\n" +
		"of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n" +
		"  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n" +
		"States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\n" +
		"software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\n" +
		"avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\n" +
		"make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\n" +

		"  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\n" +
		"to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\n" +
		"feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\n" +
		"tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\n" +
		"extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\n" +
		"work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\n" +
		"the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\n" +
		"menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n" +
		"  1. Source Code.\n\n" +
		"  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\n" +
		"for making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\n" +
		"form of a work.\n\n" +
		"  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\n" +
		"standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\n" +
		"interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\n" +
		"is widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n" +
		"  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\n" +
		"than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\n" +
		"packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\n" +
		"Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\n" +
		"Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\n" +
		"implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n" +
		"\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n" +
		"(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n" +
		"(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\n" +
		"produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n" +
		"  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\n" +
		"the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\n" +
		"work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\n" +
		"control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\n" +
		"System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\n" +
		"programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\n" +
		"which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\n" +
		"includes interface definition files associated with source files for\n" +
		"the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\n" +
		"linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\n" +
		"such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\n" +
		"subprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n" +
		"  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\n" +
		"can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\n" +
		"Source.\n\n" +
		"  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\n" +
		"same work.\n\n" +
		"  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n" +
		"  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\n" +
		"copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\n" +
		"conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\n" +
		"permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\n" +
		"covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\n" +
		"content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\n" +
		"rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n" +
		"  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\n" +
		"convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\n" +
		"in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\n" +
		"of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\n" +
		"with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\n" +
		"the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\n" +
		"not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\n" +
		"for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\n" +
		"and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\n" +
		"your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n" +
		"  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\n" +
		"the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\n" +
		"makes it unnecessary.\n\n" +
		"  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n" +
		"  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\n" +
		"measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n" +
		"11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\n" +
		"similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\n" +
		"measures.\n\n" +
		"  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\n" +
		"circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\n" +
		"is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\n" +
		"the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\n" +
		"modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\n" +
		"users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\n" +
		"technological measures.\n\n" +
		"  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n" +
		"  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\n" +
		"receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\n" +
		"appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\n" +
		"keep intact all notices stating that this License and any\n" +
		"non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\n" +
		"keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\n" +
		"recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n" +
		"  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\n" +
		"and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n" +
		"  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n" +
		"  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\n" +
		"produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\n" +
		"terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n" +
		"    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n" +
		"    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n" +
		"    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n" +
		"    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n" +
		"    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n" +
		"    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n" +
		"    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n" +
		"    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n" +
		"    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n" +
		"    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n" +
		"    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n" +
		"    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n" +
		"    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n" +
		"    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n" +
		"    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n" +
		"    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n" +
		"    work need not make them do so.\n\n" +
		"  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\n" +
		"works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\n" +
		"and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\n" +
		"in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n" +
		"\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\n" +
		"used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\n" +
		"beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\n" +
		"in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\n" +
		"parts of the aggregate.\n\n" +
		"  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n" +
		"  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\n" +
		"of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\n" +
		"machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\n" +
		"in one of these ways:\n\n" +
		"    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n" +
		"    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n" +
		"    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n" +
		"    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n" +
		"    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n" +
		"    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n" +
		"    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n" +
		"    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n" +
		"    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n" +
		"    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n" +
		"    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n" +
		"    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n" +
		"    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n" +
		"    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n" +
		"    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n" +
		"    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n" +
		"    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n" +
		"    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n" +
		"    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n" +
		"    with subsection 6b.\n\n" +
		"    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n" +
		"    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n" +
		"    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n" +
		"    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n" +
		"    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n" +
		"    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n" +
		"    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n" +
		"    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n" +
		"    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n" +
		"    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n" +
		"    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n" +
		"    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n" +
		"    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n" +
		"    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n" +
		"    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n" +
		"    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n" +
		"  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\n" +
		"from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\n" +
		"included in conveying the object code work.\n\n" +
		"  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\n" +
		"tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\n" +
		"or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\n" +
		"into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\n" +
		"doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\n" +
		"product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\n" +
		"typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\n" +
		"of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\n" +
		"actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\n" +
		"is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\n" +
		"commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\n" +
		"the only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n" +
		"  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\n" +
		"procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\n" +
		"and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\n" +
		"a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\n" +
		"suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\n" +
		"code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\n" +
		"modification has been made.\n\n" +
		"  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\n" +
		"specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\n" +
		"part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\n" +
		"User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\n" +
		"fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\n" +
		"Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\n" +
		"by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\n" +
		"if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\n" +
		"modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\n" +
		"been installed in ROM).\n\n" +
		"  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\n" +
		"requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\n" +
		"for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\n" +
		"the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\n" +
		"network may be denied when the modification itself materially and\n" +
		"adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\n" +
		"protocols for communication across the network.\n\n" +
		"  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\n" +
		"in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\n" +
		"documented (and with an implementation available to the public in\n" +
		"source code form), and must require no special password or key for\n" +
		"unpacking, reading or copying.\n\n" +
		"  7. Additional Terms.\n\n" +
		"  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\n" +
		"License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\n" +
		"Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\n" +
		"be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\n" +
		"that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\n" +
		"apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\n" +
		"under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\n" +
		"this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n" +
		"  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\n" +
		"remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\n" +
		"it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\n" +
		"removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\n" +
		"additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\n" +
		"for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n" +
		"  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\n" +
		"add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\n" +
		"that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n" +
		"    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n" +
		"    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n" +
		"    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n" +
		"    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n" +
		"    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n" +
		"    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n" +
		"    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n" +
		"    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n" +
		"    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n" +
		"    authors of the material; or\n\n" +
		"    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n" +
		"    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n" +
		"    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n" +
		"    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n" +
		"    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n" +
		"    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n" +
		"    those licensors and authors.\n\n" +
		"  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\n" +
		"restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\n" +
		"received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\n" +
		"governed by this License along with a term that is a further\n" +
		"restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\n" +
		"a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\n" +
		"License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\n" +
		"of that license document, provided that the further restriction does\n" +
		"not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n" +
		"  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\n" +
		"must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\n" +
		"additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\n" +
		"where to find the applicable terms.\n\n" +
		"  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\n" +
		"form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\n" +
		"the above requirements apply either way.\n\n" +
		"  8. Termination.\n\n" +
		"  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\n" +
		"provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\n" +
		"modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\n" +
		"this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\n" +
		"paragraph of section 11).\n\n" +
		"  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\n" +
		"license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\n" +
		"provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\n" +
		"finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\n" +
		"holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\n" +
		"prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n" +
		"  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\n" +
		"reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\n" +
		"violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\n" +
		"received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\n" +
		"copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\n" +
		"your receipt of the notice.\n\n" +
		"  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\n" +
		"licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\n" +
		"this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\n" +
		"reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\n" +
		"material under section 10.\n\n" +
		"  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n" +
		"  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\n" +
		"run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\n" +
		"occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\n" +
		"to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\n" +
		"nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\n" +
		"modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\n" +
		"not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\n" +
		"covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n" +
		"  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n" +
		"  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\n" +
		"receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\n" +
		"propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\n" +
		"for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n" +
		"  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\n" +
		"organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\n" +
		"organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\n" +
		"work results from an entity transaction, each party to that\n" +
		"transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\n" +
		"licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\n" +
		"give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\n" +
		"Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\n" +
		"the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n" +
		"  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\n" +
		"rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\n" +
		"not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\n" +
		"rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n" +
		"(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\n" +
		"any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\n" +
		"sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n" +
		"  11. Patents.\n\n" +
		"  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\n" +
		"License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\n" +
		"work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n" +
		"  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\n" +
		"owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\n" +
		"hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\n" +
		"by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\n" +
		"but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\n" +
		"consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\n" +
		"purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\n" +
		"patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\n" +
		"this License.\n\n" +
		"  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\n" +
		"patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\n" +
		"make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\n" +
		"propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n" +
		"  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\n" +
		"agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n" +
		"(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\n" +
		"sue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\n" +
		"party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\n" +
		"patent against the party.\n\n" +
		"  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\n" +
		"and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\n" +
		"to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\n" +
		"publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\n" +
		"then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\n" +
		"available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\n" +
		"patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\n" +
		"consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\n" +
		"license to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\n" +
		"actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\n" +
		"covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\n" +
		"in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\n" +
		"country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n" +
		"  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\n" +
		"arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\n" +
		"covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\n" +
		"receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\n" +
		"or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\n" +
		"you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\n" +
		"work and works based on it.\n\n" +
		"  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\n" +
		"the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\n" +
		"conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\n" +
		"specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\n" +
		"work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\n" +
		"in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\n" +
		"to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\n" +
		"the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\n" +
		"parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\n" +
		"patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\n" +
		"conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\n" +
		"for and in connection with specific products or compilations that\n" +
		"contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\n" +
		"or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n" +
		"  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\n" +
		"any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\n" +
		"otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n" +
		"  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n" +
		"  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n" +
		"otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n" +
		"excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\n" +
		"covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n" +
		"License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\n" +
		"not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\n" +
		"to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\n" +
		"the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\n" +
		"License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n" +
		"  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n" +
		"  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\n" +
		"permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\n" +
		"under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\n" +
		"combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\n" +
		"License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\n" +
		"but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\n" +
		"section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\n" +
		"combination as such.\n\n" +
		"  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n" +
